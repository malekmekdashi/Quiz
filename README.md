the intentions of this assignment was to create a quiz that tests one's knowledge about javascript, and API's

When one pushes the start quiz button, you initiate the quiz and a timer begins to run down. In that time, you must answer a series of questions, and for every question you get right, a point is added to your score. However, for every question you get wrong, 15 is reduced from the timer.
